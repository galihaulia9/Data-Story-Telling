Week ten learns about Communication (Visualization & Story Telling).

### Data Understanding
This dataset contains information about the COVID-19 Social Assistance program in DKI Jakarta. The data includes the number of aid recipients from two entities, namely the Ministry of Social Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemensos RI) and the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta. There are two groups of recipients, namely those with a DKI ID and those with a Non DKI ID who live in Jakarta. The total number of aid recipients from both entities is 2.4 million families who are vulnerable to COVID-19. This dataset can be used to monitor the distribution and effectiveness of social assistance programs during the PSBB period in DKI Jakarta.

Based on the data generated, you can see a comparison of the number of aid recipients (KK) in various areas of DKI Jakarta. So it can be seen that the city area of East Jakarta had the most aid recipients that year and the lowest aid recipient area was the Thousand Islands with a percentage of 1.51%. This percentage result is calculated based on the total data of aid recipients (KK) in the DKI Jakarta city area. In other words, the Thousand Islands region only has about 1.51% of the number of recipients (KK) in East Jakarta.

Based on the data, it can be seen that the lowest number of recipients based on RW is RW 23 with 0.43% of households and RW 24 and RW 25 have the same number of recipients, which is 0.68% of total recipients (KK).

Based on the data, it is known that there are 5 lowest sub-districts with the least number of recipients (KK), namely Gambir Subdistrict as much as 2.5% calculated from the total number of recipients (KK) based on the sub-district. This shows that Kecamatan Gambir has a relatively lower level of assistance (KK) than other kecamatan in the region.

Based on the data, this shows that over a given period, the distribution of groceries is distributed evenly between these types of groceries. Each type of food has an equally important contribution to social aid programs, covering basic food and public health needs.
